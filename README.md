# YOLO Object Detection Project

This repository contains a YOLO object detection project implemented from scratch in PyTorch.  
**Note:** This model is overfitted on a small dataset because my laptop does not have high specs to train the full dataset.

## Features
- Custom YOLO model implementation in PyTorch
- Object detection on custom datasets
- Supports large model checkpoints via Git LFS
- Inference scripts and sample results included

## Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Arunesh2805/Object_Detection---YOLO-v1-from-scratch.git

# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python matplotlib Pillow

# Train the YOLO model
python train.py
# (It will automatically load checkpoint.pth and show results)
```
